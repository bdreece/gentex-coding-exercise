# Gentex Coding Exercise

This is a submission repository for the Machine Vision Development Engineer
coding exercise from Gentex.

## Running the program

My solution to the coding exercise is a .NET console application, which can be
built and run with the following commands:

```bash
dotnet build gentex
dotnet run gentex input.csv output.csv
```

## Known bugs

There are a few bugs with this implementation that I've found:

- Output CSV missing last ~50 shapes or so, not sure why.
