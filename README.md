# Gentex Coding Exercise

This is a submission repository for the Machine Vision Development Engineer coding exercise from Gentex.

# Running the program

My solution to the coding exercise is a .NET console application, which can be run with the following command:

```bash
$ dotnet run gentex [INPUT_CSV] [OUTPUT_CSV]
```
